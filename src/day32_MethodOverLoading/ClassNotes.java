       Method Recap
package name: day32_MethodOverloading
Warmup tasks:
    1. write a method that can retunr the full name of a person in regular format
            ex:
                formatFullName("cYbErTeK", "SCHOOL"); ==> "Cybertek School"
    2. write a return method that accepts two numbers and an operator, then returns calculation result.
             if the oerator is invalid, return zero
             otherwise return the result
    3. write a method that can add element to an array, the method accepts an array and and a number,
    then returns the new array by appending the number to the last index of the given array
        Ex:
            int[] arr = {1,2,3};
            int num = 4;
            addElement(arr, num); ===> {1,2,3,4}
method overloading: multiple methods have same method name
             advantage: 1. easy to remember
                        2. easy to read
                        3. reusable
                        4. flexible

                    parameter MUST be different (either dataType or number of parameters)
tasks1:
    1. create a method that can find the addition of two numbers
                        addition2Numbers
    2. create a method that can find the addition of three numbers
                        addition3Numbers
    3. create a method that can find the addition of four numbers
                        addition4Numbers
                        addition
